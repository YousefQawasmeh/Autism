      <h3>First Concerns to Action Roadmap<h3><div class="text-p">
If you have concerns about your child’s development, early intervention is important. <br> Learning the signs, examining your child’s developmental milestones, <br> and getting an evaluation and treatment as early as possible can make a lifetime of difference.
</div><h3>What to Do While Changing Behaviors in Autism?<h3><div class="text-p">
Problems in autism should be slowly and carefully changed. <br> Setting target behaviors and trying to adjust to them one-by-one is a safe <br> and sure process to follow during autism therapy.<br><br><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo2">Read More</button><br><br> <br> <div id="demo2" class="collapse"> 
Trying to solve a problem immediately may weaken the trust and tolerance of <br> the child towards parents. Eating habits that were acquired in time may also <br> turn into fat and excess weight since the child is not active. Well-balanced diet is important in these <br> kinds of conduct disorders.</div>
</div><h3>Know the Reasons Behind Applying Behavior<h3><div class="text-p">
Children with autism generally behave in a way that’s considered not normal due to a reason. <br>
 For instance, they may have destructive behavior like throwing objects across the room or make loud <br> noises to get their parent’s attention.<br><br><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo1">Read More</button><br><br>
<div id="demo1" class="collapse"> This purely results from wanting to draw attention. However, to minimize and decrease these problem behaviors, the child should be guided patiently. This increases the likelihood of positive behavior.
Just like every other child, children with autism may also cry or whine when they want to avoid or quit a task they do not want. If these types of behaviors occur excessively, they should be talked to and reassured with patience.
There may be hundreds of situations and behaviors the child does not like at school or home. Parents should determine and list these situations and behaviors that cause the child to yell and be uneasy to avoid them. The factors that affect the child in the environment should be assessed carefully. This way, the reactions the child shows would be a way to communicate.</div>
</div><h3>First Concern to Action Tool Kit<h3><div class="text-p">
If you have a concern about how your child is communicating, interacting or behaving, <br> you are probably wondering what to do next.
<br>The First Concern to Action Tool Kit can help you sort that out.<br> The purpose of this tool kit is to provide you with specific resources and tools <br>to help guide you on the journey from your first concern to action.<br>
The kit was developed to provide families of children under the age of five with:
<br><br><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo20">Read More</button><br><br>
        <div id="demo20" class="collapse">   <br> • An overview of early child development;
   <br> • Guidance on what to do if you have a concern about your child's development;
   <br> • Information about obtaining an evaluation for your child's development and treatment options, if needed.
The kit is divided into the following sections:
<br> • Introduction and About Autism
<br> • Understanding Your Child's Development
<br> • Talking to Your Health Care Provider
<br> • Getting a Formal Evaluation
<br> • What if My Health Care Provider Says "Autism"?
<br> • Other Things to Know
<br> • Tools and Resources for Families
</div>
</div><h3>When it Comes to Taking Action for Conduct Disorder<h3><div class="text-p">
After listing behaviors that trouble the child, <br> parents and experts should elaborately determine the most important elements<br> and take action accordingly. If the child has developed a behavior like biting self or people <br>around him, the action should be started on the most harmful behaviors such as that.<br><br><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo100">Read More</button><br><br>
<div id="demo100" class="collapse"> During the process of treatment and afterwards, parents and experts should both stay stable and the <br>treatment should be applied consistently.
When this consistency is established in every environment,<br> the education of the child succeeds and the behavior sticks with the child.<br> With a successful education, the child suffering from autism can better adapt to normal life <br>and problems that may occur in the future would be easy to overcome.<br> The child, who has the chance to live a more comfortable life for both himself and his parents,<br> can even increase the quality of his life more by receiving higher education.
